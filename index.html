      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The need for accurate heatwave predictions has never been greater,
        especially in the context of climate change. Heatwaves pose significant
        risks to human health, infrastructure, and the environment. Our
        motivation is to contribute to solving this problem using data-driven
        models.

      <h2>Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        Our workflow involves collecting data from multiple sources, including
        weather reports, satellite images, and historical heat data. We then
        preprocess and analyze this data using deep learning models, such as
        LSTM and GRU, to predict future heatwave events.

        <h2>Diving Deep into West Bengal's Heatwaves: Our Approach Using ERA5-HEAT Data</h2>
      
        <p>For the research on extreme heatwaves in West Bengal, we're leveraging the power of the ERA5-HEAT dataset provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).</p>
      
        <h3>What is ERA5-HEAT?</h3>
        <p>ERA5-HEAT is a highly reliable dataset derived from the ERA5 reanalysis, a comprehensive global dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It provides crucial information like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT):</strong> MRT represents the average radiant heat that a human body would experience from its surroundings. It's calculated by considering factors like air temperature, solar radiation, and longwave radiation emitted by the environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI):</strong> UTCI is a more holistic index that integrates multiple environmental factors, including air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and radiation. It provides a more accurate assessment of the overall thermal stress experienced by the human body compared to simple air temperature measurements.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Data Selection</h3>
        <p>To focus on the critical pre-monsoon period and recent trends, we've selected data from <strong>2013 to 2024</strong> for the months of <strong>April, May, and June</strong>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, to ensure a localized analysis, we've narrowed down our focus to a specific region within West Bengal. This allows for a more in-depth understanding of the unique heat stress patterns within this area.</p>
      
        <h3>Why This Data Matters</h3>
        <p>This dataset is invaluable for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understanding Heatwave Trends: Analyzing the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves in West Bengal.</li>
          <li>Identifying Vulnerable Populations: Pinpointing areas and groups most at risk from heat stress.</li>
          <li>Assessing Climate Change Impacts: Evaluating how climate change is likely to affect heatwave patterns and their impacts.</li>
          <li>Developing Effective Mitigation Strategies: Supporting the development of early warning systems and urban planning solutions to mitigate heat stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          By tracking the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) values over
          time for the West Bengal region, we observe a gradual shift in the
          intensity and distribution of heatwaves. Initially, the highest UTCI
          values were concentrated in the central parts of West Bengal,
          indicating extreme heat events. However, as time progresses, the
          intensity of these heatwaves is shifting towards the southwestern part
          of India, suggesting a potential change in regional heatwave patterns.
          This shift highlights the importance of monitoring and understanding
          local climate variations to predict and mitigate future extreme heat
          events in the region.
